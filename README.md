_Network based wallpapers for MacOS_
⚠️ Project is not finished yet, still under construction. ⚠️
<hr>

## Project goal and information
This project started as a problem I was facing. 
I'm someone who's moving around a lot between different locations.
The problem? I want a different set of wallpapers when I'm at home vs when I'm somewhere else.

This led to the creation of this project, a smarter way to manage your wallpapers based on the network you're connected to.
Just pick your wallpaper folder (currently only folders because that's what I use), pick the network you want it to be associated with and you're good to go. 
Whenever you connect to a different network the software will check for a wallpaper setup and apply it when found.

## Disclaimer
This is my first MacOS project, so the code won't be perfect. Feel free to improve, criticize and contribute.
